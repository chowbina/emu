## Main Issues

Commerce data provides data that is optimal for planning and research of general socioeconomic and demographic patterns. Generally, increased geographic specificity equates to longer time steps. Shorter time steps equates to more geographic aggregation. 

The data does not provide sufficient resolution to develop high resolution market segmentation, which likely requires new factors of business quality and activity. 

## Your Contribution

By bushwhacking through emerging data sources, you will help demonstrate the value of using newer data sources as a complementary source of information and find ways to increase the 'resolution of insights' beyond what is available through government data alone

Act as product managers who will  democratize 'market intelligence' by characterizing local markets in ways that people can imagine as opposed to traditional printouts. (e.g. Census tract X is comprised largely of big box and large corporate retail, Census tract Y has 1 starbucks but many local businesses, Census tract Z has largely low restaurants ratings with an older customer base)

## Important Points for Commerce

Demonstrating cross-compatibility of mature Commerce data and emerging data from novel sources through market segmentation

Commerce data is defined loosely as either:

A geographic area that is specific to the Commerce (e.g. Census tracts, block groups)

Actual data produced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bureau of the Census or other bureau

## Getting Data

US Census Bureauâ€™s ACS-5-year Census Tract Summaries (Census Site or NHGIS - Easier to Use)

Description: The American Community Survey (ACS) is collected annually by the US Census Bureau and aids in monitoring trends and prepare for future data collection efforts. The 5-year Census tract summaries data contains tract-level aggregates for 2009 through 2013. 

## US Census Tract Shapefiles (here)

Description: In order to visualize tracts or conduct spatial join operations, the US Census Tract Shapefiles (vector polygon) are required.

Starbucks Locations (here)

Description: An open data post on Socrata containing Starbucks locations around the world. Candidate dataset for a lead metric of market change. 

Yelp Challenge Data (here)

Description: A multi-city selection of Yelp data (businesses, reviews, users) available through bulk download or API.
